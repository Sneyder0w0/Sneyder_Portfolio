          I’m Sneyder Orellana, a student passionate about 
          technology, programming, and data analytics. 
          I’m currently part of the ¡Supérate! program, where I’ve developed 
          both technical and leadership skills.
        </p>

        <p className="about-text">
          I enjoy learning new technologies, creating digital solutions, 
          and exploring how data can drive meaningful change. 
          Outside of tech, I also love volunteering and collaborating 
          with others to make a positive impact.
